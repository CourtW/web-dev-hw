  <h1> <b> About Fall Desserts </h1></b>
<p> "Fall" in love with the holidays by making this Autumn Apple Pie. Rachael Ray shares her best kept recipes that bring out the flavor of baked apples. This dessert is sure to bring people together- share a slice! </p>
<p> Quiet in the kitchen? Play this music while baking to get in the country spirit! Cooking should be a fun experience. </p>
