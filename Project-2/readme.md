# Instructable Readme.md

- This week I took notes on code that we will continue to use. It was fun writing code and building my webpage.
-  I chose an apple pie recipe by Rachael Ray. I think writing out a recipe requires many of the semantic tags we were using such as: ordered and unordered list, bolding and using superscript. In the future I think my recipe instructable will work well for adding images.
- 10/9/2017 I found this week easier as we are repeating many familiar code. I found it helpful to use a table and images to illustrate my instructable webpage. I learned many useful semantics.
- 10/23 I thought it was challenging and interesting learning how to imbed and use iframes to add media content and maps to my site. I am having an issue viewing a potion of my about page including my google map. Not sure where I am going wrong with my code on the about page. I can view all of my page in the markdown toggle preview but it is not displaying on my live page...?
