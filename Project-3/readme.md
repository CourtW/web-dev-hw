- I want to use a cursive font that will appeal to many of Rachael Ray's fans. Indie flower and indie pacifico fit with the fun theme.
- I want to use bright colors such as yellow and orange to fit with the fall cooking webpages.
- I want to reference a cook book by rachael ray and link to purchase it on Amazon using pseudo-lass element.
-  I will use reviews for the book from Amazon. I plan to highlight these reviews with font styling so that they stand out to readers.

- I am having trouble previewing my fonts in atom.
