<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><quote>"Meal time can get to be real redundant because you develop a go to menu that is simple and quick. Rachael's book brings some new ideas to the table that are still quick and esy and don't break the bank" Byimabusybee23</quote></p>
<p><quote>"One can never go wrong with Rachael Ray. I have been a fan since her 30 minute meals program. I have never been disappointed with any of her recipes. I will continue to use this book for a very long time!" By Sylvia T. Murillo-renard</quote></p>
